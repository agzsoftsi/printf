.SH NAME
.B _printf
- formatted output conversion
.SH SYNOPSIS
#include "holberton.h"
.br
\fIint\fR
.br
.B printf (\fIconst\fR \fIchar\fR \fI*format\fR, \fI...\fR);
.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.B_printf()
produces output according to a format as described.
.SH CONVERSION SPECIFIERS
The conversion specifiers and their meanings are:
.TP
.BR c
The  int argument is converted to an unsigned char
.TP
.B s
The char * argument is expected to be a pointer to an array of character type (pointer to a string).  Characters from the array are written up to (but not including) a terminating NUL character; if a precision is specified, no more than the number specified are written.  If a precision is given, no null character need be present; if the precision is not specified, or is greater than the size of the array, the array must contain a terminating NUL character.
.TP
.B %
A  `%'  is  written.  No argument is converted. The complete conversion specification is `%%'.
.TP
.B d,i
The  int    argument is converted to signed decimal notation.  The precision, if any, gives the minimum number of digits that  must appear;  if  the converted  value  requires fewer digits, it is padded on the left with zeros. The default precision is 1.  When 0  is printed with an explicit precision 0, the output is empty.
.SH RETURN VALUE
Upon successful return, this function returns the number of characters printed (not including the trailing `\\0' used to end output to strings).
.SH SEE ALSO

.SH BUGS
No known bugs.
.SH EXAMPLES
INSTRUCTION: _printf("Let's try to printf a simple sentence.\n");
OUTPUT:      Let's try to printf a simple sentence.

INSTRUCTION: len = _printf("Let's try to printf a simple sentence.\n");
	       _printf("Length:[%d, %i]\n", len, len);
OUTPUT:      Length:[39, 39]

INSTRUCTION: _printf("Negative:[%d]\n", -762534);
OUTPUT:	     Negative:[-762534]

INSTRUCTION: _printf("Character:[%c]\n", 'H');
OUTPUT:	     Character:[H]
     
INSTRUCTION: _printf("String:[%s]\n", "I am a string !");
OUTPUT:	     String:[I am a string !]

INSTRUCTION: _printf("Percent:[%%]\n");
OUTPUT:	     Percent:[%]
